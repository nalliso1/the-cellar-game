# UNB SUB Game Project

This is a 2D game project developed in **Godot** for the **CS2053: Game Development** course at the **University of New Brunswick**. The game takes place inside a virtual version of the UNB Student Union Building (SUB), where players explore floors and rooms to complete mini-games.

## 📚 Description

The game features a 2D side-scrolling exploration system that simulates walking through the UNB Student Union Building (SUB). Players move across the building's main hallway in a side-scroller format (X/Y axis), entering different rooms through doors on each floor.

Each room transitions to a **top-down view** where the player can freely move around and interact with the environment. To play the mini-game inside a room, the player must navigate to a specific location or object.

- **The Cellar**: A top-down bar where players can walk around and approach the card table to play *Ride the Bus*
- **The Cafeteria**: A top-down cafateria area where players walk to the Ping Pong table to start a match
- **The S-Club**: A top-down club where players find the card table to play *horse racing* mini-game

The objective is to **complete all mini-games** in the different rooms to finish the game.
